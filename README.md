# CPSC 501 Assignment 3 Report
Repo Link: https://gitlab.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/stephen.dios/cpsc-501-assignment-3

NOTE:
The tabbing for the visualizer is a little bit buggy.
- Objects are displayed in the order they occur, so if you have an object with instances a, b, c, then Objects a, b, and c
will be listed directly under that object in the exact order.
- When displaying an object5, it will display the results twice 

## 1 Refactor
Commit: e7481473
I had 2 functions that did the exact same thing except for a single line, so I removed the duplicate
function.


This was the only case of a deliberate refactoring. I had instances throughout the project where I made small corrections
but did not document them as separate commits.
